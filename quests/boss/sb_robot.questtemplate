  "text": "Heya, friendo! I've got another task for you-- a two-for-one kinda deal. One of my suppliers found some sorta tattered robot blueprint in an old desert landfill. Now, normally I don't care much about other people's toys, but from what I gather, ^green;the bot produces some advanced ^orange;processor^reset;, and I'd very much like to get my flippers on one. ^green;Think you could build the ^orange;Inactive Robot^green; at an ^orange;Iron Tool Table^green; and see what happens?^reset;", //direct player to iron table instead of upgraded inventors b/c the robot parts are crafted there
  "completionText": "The bot attacked you?! I'm glad you survived, and you've even got the processor! The supplier and I did some more work on deciphering the blueprint notes; those processors are great for compact synchronized automation stations. This'll help a lot, thanks! Why don't you help yourself to some spare mech components I have laying around?",
