    "Upon first contact with the Floran Brood in [REDACTED], the USCM far underestimated the level of aggression, cunning, and savagery the Floran race would eventually become known for.

During one of the many border skirmishes with the expansionist Florans, Commander [REDACTED] of the Sabre-class Battlecruiser USS [REDACTED] attempted to relieve embattled USCM troops by covering advancing Floran forces with thousands of gallons of Solution 2, 4-D, otherwise known as herbicide.",

"The effect however, did not perform as expected, with the solution having roughly the same poisonous qualities as alcohol does to a human.

Nevertheless, the move 'distracted' the Florans enough for the marines to launch a counterattack and overwhelm them, securing the planetside colony long enough to complete its emergency evacuation.

The tactic has not seen use since, but lives on in history as the [REDACTED] Manoeuvre."
