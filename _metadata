  "description" : "[b]Betabound[/b] is a [b]base-game enhancement mod[/b] which adds tons of content consistent with the Starbound vision throughout the entire game-- from beginning to end! Although Betabound certainly has a strong presence throughout the game, it is [b]not[/b] an overhaul mod and will never outright replace content from Starbound. [b]Betabound is present, but not overwhelming.[/b]\n\nFrom the smallest quality of life changes to brand-new content, Betabound is a treasure trove of Starbound content!\n\n\n• New mining tools! Craft them and mine, but keep an eye on their durability bar! You can use ores to repair your tools.\n• New quests! Visit the Outpost and help it grow by helping those in need!\n• Enhance your ship by crafting! More fuel, faster non-FTL travel, reduced fuel costs!\n• Powerful food items which bestow useful status effects and instantly restore health and energy!\n• Unique biome-themed weapons to add spice to your universe!\n• New objects to decorate with!\n• New resources with new uses! Alien Seaweed, for example, is used to make an item to keep food fresh while in the inventory.\n• New tech for all existing tech slots... and a new tech slot!\n\n[url=https://discord.gg/5Xpc5VwnMx][img]https://i.imgur.com/jFMk4n0.png[/img][/url]\n\n[h1]Wanna see what the new update did?

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2295935729]Get the patch here![/url]\nA trypophobia patch exists! [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2496201241]This is where you can get it![/url]\n\n\n[Q] Other mods focusing on beta content exist. Why should I use Betabound?\n[A] Unlike those mods, Betabound asks and answers \"What would it look like if it actually got finished?\"\n\n[Q] Does Betabound replace vanilla content?\n[A] [b]No.[/b] Betabound and vanilla content are seamlessly integrated with each other, offering an experience that any Starbound player can enjoy regardless if they've played the original beta.\n\n[Q] Can I use (mod) with this mod?\n[A] [b]Yes! Betabound is highly compatible with most mods.[/b]\n\n[Q] Are there any mods that are redundant when Betabound is installed, and should I be concerned?\n[A] Betabound works quite well even when redundant mods are installed, so [b]there is no urgent need to remove any redundant mods[/b] you may have. However, it may be wise to check out the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2010607826/4357873056144718990/]Redundant Mods List[/url]. Bear in mind that some mods may only be partially redundant and still offer unique experiences.\n\nMany people have helped to create Betabound.
