  "description" : "[b]Betabound[/b] is a [b]vanilla+ base-game enhancement mod[/b] which adds tons of content consistent with the Starbound vision throughout the entire game-- from beginning to end! Although Betabound certainly has a strong presence throughout the game, it is [b]not[/b] an overhaul mod and will never outright replace content from Starbound, allowing it to fit into any mod list! [b]Betabound is present, but not overwhelming.[/b]\n\nFrom the smallest quality of life changes to brand-new content, Betabound is a treasure trove of Starbound content!\n\n• [b]Techs![/b] A new tech slot, and new techs for all slots!\n• [b]Quests![/b] Visit the Outpost and help those in need!\n• [b]Ships![/b] Enhance your ship's stats by crafting! More fuel storage, faster non-FTL travel, and reduced fuel costs!\n• [b]New items![/b] Weapons, medicine, tools, food, crops, clothes, objects, throwables, and more!\n• [b]Biomes![/b] New biomes above and over-ground.\n• [b]Crafting![/b] New crafting stations for new item types, new resources for old crafting stations!\n• [b]Structures & Dungeons![/b] New buildings to find!\n[b]Decorations![/b] New blocks and furniture to find or craft!\n\nAs of May 2025, Betabound currently adds/enables:\n• 176 Weapons (This count excludes racial variants)\n• 123 Food Items/Consumables\n• 98 Objects\n• 64 Tools/Equipment\n• 61 Miscellaneous items\n• 58 Codices/Lore Items (Adjusted to not contradict vanilla lore)\n• 52 Techs\n• 42 Clothing Items\n• 39 Blocks/Platforms\n• 25 Quests\n• 19 Throwable Items\n• 6 Biomes\n• 12 Friendly NPCs\n• 19 Hostile NPCs\n• 19 Structures\n• 679 Crafting Recipes\n\n  \n\n[url=https://discord.gg/5Xpc5VwnMx][img]https://i.imgur.com/jFMk4n0.png[/img][/url]\n\n[h1]Wanna see what the new update did? [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/2010607826]Click here![/url]\nAlso make sure to check out the [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3172121173]Recommended Mods For Betabound[/url][/b] collection and grab [url=https://github.com/OpenStarbound/OpenStarbound/blob/main/README.md]OpenStarbound[/url]!\nBetabound has official patches. Find them [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/managecollection/?id=3491916639]here![/url][/h1]\n\n\n[b][Q][/b] Other mods focus on beta content. Why should I use Betabound?\n[b][A][/b] Betabound asks and answers \"What would it look like if beta content got finished?\" Some functionality required for some beta content no longer exists in modern Starbound- Betabound goes the extra mile and recreates the missing functionality and supplies its own descriptions, icon, and whatever else was missing from the original beta!\n\n[b][Q][/b] Is this just improved versions of beta content?\n[b][A][/b] No! Betabound has tweaks to vanilla content, adds recreations of alpha content, enables unused vanilla content, and offers original content!\n[b][Q][/b] Does Betabound replace/remove XYZ?\n[b][A][/b] [b]No.[/b] Betabound and vanilla content are seamlessly integrated with each other, offering an experience that any Starbound player can enjoy regardless if they've played the original beta.\n\n[b][Q][/b] Can I use (mod) with this mod?\n[b][A][/b] [b]Yes! Betabound is highly compatible with most mods and has built-in integration patches for others.[/b]\n\n[b][Q][/b] How do I get steel bars, a processor, and a peanut butter trap?\n[b][A][/b] The [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2010607826/599643064665910435/]progression guide[/url] includes information on how to get all of these!\n\nMany people have helped to create Betabound.
