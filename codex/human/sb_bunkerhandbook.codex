    "Upon first contact with the Floran Brood in ^red;[REDACTED]^reset;, the USCM far underestimated the level of cunningly aggressive savagery the Floran race would eventually become known for.

During one of the many border skirmishes with the expansionist Florans, Commander ^red;[REDACTED]^reset; of the Sabre-class Battlecruiser USS ^red;[REDACTED]^reset; attempted to relieve embattled USCM troops by covering advancing Floran forces with thousands of gallons of Solution 2, 4-D, otherwise known as herbicide.",

"The effect however, did not perform as expected, with the solution having roughly the same poisonous qualities as alcohol does to a human.

Nevertheless, the move 'distracted' the Florans enough for the marines to launch a counterattack and overwhelm them, securing the planetside colony long enough to complete its emergency evacuation.

The tactic has not seen use since, but lives on in history as the ^red;[REDACTED]^reset; Manoeuvre."
