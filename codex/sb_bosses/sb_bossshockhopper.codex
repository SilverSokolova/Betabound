"I've been commissioned by ^red;[REDACTED]^reset; to produce a weaponised vehicle built for Penguinkind. He showed me an example of what he wanted- a ruined rusted robot found on an abandoned planet.

I was intrigued; the old thing was crude in design and seemed to have been piloted with an animal brain. Terrible choice, who could possibly think that was a good idea? I accepted the task, fascinated with the origins of this junkyard automaton.",

"Further examination of the robot has allowed me to tear out the best bits for a headstart on my new machine - Project Shockhopper, as I'm now calling it. The old bot features remains of rocket launchers, battle claws, and a flamethrower.

The claws will have to go- I'm thinking a hydraulic fist instead. With a few fixes, the flamethrower could be a viable weapon. I also have an old electric coil lying about in my lab, which I converted into an offensive feature (I'm clever like that).",

"The work has been arduous, but I have finally finished my first completed model. The Shockhopper Mk I is functioning! I have contacted a friend to see if they know anyone that would make a good \"volunteer\" for my first test run. I have high hopes.",

"But something lingers in the back of my mind no matter how hard I try to let it slip. I brought one of my suppliers to the location my client found the robot, and they found its blueprints in a landfill.

The robot my client showed me was missing a component which the blueprint describes - an amazingly specialised processor. I want it, and presumably my client did as well. He must have taken it from the robot before commissioning me, but how did he know where to look?"
