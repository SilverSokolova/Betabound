look im gonna be honest with you i have no idea how this thing is suppose to be held
im guessing it's like a staff, with the curled part being the tip of the staff? the part that you point at your enemies
or maybe the part at the top of the image is the end, and the curled part is like a battery or something

chucklefish just dropped it into the assets, never did anything with it, only touched it *once* ever, then removed it
