"It's not often a Glitch bounty hunter finds themselves tasked with visiting a human settlement, and yet here I am. I will be honest; I'm not fond of humans. They appear Glitch-like but fleshy, though without the hardy muscular physique of the Apex.

Here, though... In this place, I can't help but pity them. Misery and torment seems to exude from every surface. Graffiti marks the walls; cries for help and sinister warnings. Something terrible once walked these halls and I would be blind to deny it.",

"I am here on the behest of Platinum Ace, tracking down an Apex whom stole the locations of a number of Glitch outcast camps. This Apex, I was told, had disguised himself as a human and promptly been thrown into prison.

If he was here, however, he isn't any more. This place is desolate and ruined-- Was it a mistake to come here? Were I not in control of my body, I imagine I'd be feeling chills run down my spine.

I do not like this place."
