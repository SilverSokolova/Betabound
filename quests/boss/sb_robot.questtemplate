Now, normally I don't care much about other people's toys, but from what I can gather, ^green;the bot is capable of producing some sorta advanced ^orange;processor^reset;, and I'd very much like to get my flippers on one. ^green;Think you could build the bot and see what happens?^reset;",
  "completionText": "The bot attacked you?! I'm glad you survived, and you've even got the processor! The supplier and I did some more work on deciphering the blueprint notes; those processors are great for compact synchronized automation stations. This'll help a lot, thanks! Why don't you help yourself to some spare mech components I have laying around?",
