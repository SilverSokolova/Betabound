"Something is watching me. I've descended so deep into this prison that the lights no longer work, and I am forced to navigate using night vision. As I made my way down a corridor, my scanner flickered into action, alerting me to a life sign just behind me. I whirled around, and saw nothing. Every ounce of logic I possess wants to believe it is my quarry, hiding from me in plain sight, perhaps taking stock of his pursuer.",

"Yet something- an intuition I only gained after becoming self-aware- tells me it is not him. I do not think my quarry has been alive for a long time.

I awoke in the night to the sounds of wailing. There were two strange things about this. One, I had been asleep. My progress through the prison has been so slow such that there has been no need to rest in order to recharge, and yet I was overcome with fatigue.",

"Two, no life signs detected. None. And yet the wailing was clearly coming from within the room I found myself in. A low, tortured cry, unlike anything I've heard before. Unlike any species I've heard before. I am on the verge of abandoning my mission and turning back."
