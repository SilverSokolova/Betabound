"I escaped the wrath of the Stargazers! ...Barely. My ship has run out of fuel and is orbiting some unknown planet. I long for the day I can find other Grounded, to join with likeminded people. If only I wasn't stuck floating in space.

I can't help but feel some sort of irony in this - a Grounded, stuck in the sky. Sometimes I wonder, just vaguely and in the depths of my mind, if being in space will make it easier for Kluex to find me. Then I remember I'm an atheist and feel reassured." //Enough rambling - it's time to begin my quest."
