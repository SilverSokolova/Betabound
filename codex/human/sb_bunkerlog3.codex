  "Stuck in the bunker. Again. Begged my superior officer to let me go and explore the terrain, but he was having none of it. It's hostile, he says. No it isn't! I see other species out there all the time. Just yesterday, I saw a walking, talking bird hanging out with a large monkey.

I told my superior officer this and he suggested I visit the med bay. I'll send HIM to the med bay if he doesn't start taking me seriously. Tempers sure are getting frayed around here. Let's hope we don't have any friendly fire incidents."
