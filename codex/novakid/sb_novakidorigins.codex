"Believed by many to have been forged aeons ago in the fusion furnaces of a now-dead star, the Novakids are a perfect example of nature's emergent beauty.

These creatures, described by a human astronomer as 'interstellar gas-bag people,' have no known single origin point: That information is long lost, as the Novakids have little to no desire to record their history, or even pass it on to their offspring.",

"Though they are generally more intelligent and intuitive than the 'fleshy' races, their attention spans are lacking - this does not make them any less effective in combat, but has the effect of restricting their technology research (and any groundbreaking research is forgotten within a few generations).",

"The force that drives the Novakids is contained within the brand on their faces.

Charged with huge amounts of energy, these pieces of metal generate the hard plasma 'shells' which stop their constituent gases from leaking - if a Novakid is depleted of their vital gases, the energy contained within their brand is instantly vented into the very fabric of space-time, leaving only a twisted metal symbol and a nearly undetectable warping of light around the area of death.",

"Since the Novakids have a short memory (and attention span), diplomatic relations can be strained at times; because of their completely different composition to other lifeforms, Novakids are sometimes unable to grasp the nuances of interracial social interactions, and have thus attained a slightly dubious reputation amongst other races.",

"In particular, an Avian diplomat reportedly described a Novakid he met as 'dense', and elaborated upon his statement by mentioning that the Novakid in question had cheerily asked him if his god, Kluex, was real."
