"The further I proceed into the complex, the more evidence I'm finding of the villains who once dwelt here. Thieves, terrorists, murderers; the scum of the universe. Perhaps their evil became tangible and seeped into the very walls of this place, or perhaps it is something more.

The Glitch tend not to believe in the concept of an afterlife, but many other species do. Humans, though, seem to be the most prone to superstition. Ghosts, spectres; the return of their kind to life in non-corporeal forms.",

"Perhaps it is the light playing tricks on me, but as I head onwards into the prison, I fancy I keep seeing movement out of the corner of my optics--

"When I came to, I had somehow crawled to a different room. I was lying on a prison cell's bed, and I wasn't alone. A bald doll with a singular eye sat on the mattress beside me, simply staring. It appeared to be some kind of human toy.

Then I mocked myself for doing so."
