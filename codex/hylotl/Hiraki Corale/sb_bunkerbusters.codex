    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer

My ship crash-landed on a planet. I may have been fleeing a certain simian species at the time and decided the best course of action was to lure them into an asteroid field. It worked! Of course, I have no experience navigating through asteroid fields, so here I am.",

"I found a group of humans in a hole in the ground. Not the creepy kind of hole - some kind of military bunker. I thought I'd drop in, regale them with tales of some of my adventures, but no, they were having none of it. Wouldn't even let me in. Shocking hospitality! In the end, I borrowed one of their spaceships for spare parts and left them to it."
