"What is it for a Glitch to know fear? I have felt it before, of course, but this... This is different. The more I take in the history of the prison, piecing together events from scrawled messages and disrepair, the more I begin to feel human. This species, these humans, are lost and adrift in the universe. Would it not make sense that even their very souls, if such a thing exists, cannot find peace? They have an emotional range unlike that of any other species; a conflicting, terrible sea of confusion.",

"I found a locked cell. Scans indicate a life sign from within. Something lurks in there. I know that, given the tools in my possession, I could get in. I know that I SHOULD, as it may be my quarry. And yet I hesitate.

As I wait outside the door, I hear a voice whispering to me. It calls me by name, and by names I've never heard before. It speaks of beings made of light, and beings made of darkness. It speaks of a god that will swallow the universe. It speaks of lost artifacts. And it speaks of humanity."
